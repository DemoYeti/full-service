# Supported Token Metadata

As blockchain tokens are approved by the foundation and integrated into the mobilecoin network, a need has arisen for clients to have an updated source of truth for that Token Metadata.  As such, a json file and its ed25519 signature are being hosted so that clients may retrieve and verify the updated metadata without the need to ship an update.



## Details:

The current list of approved tokens can be found at: [https://config.mobilecoin.foundation/token\_metadata.json](https://config.mobilecoin.foundation/token\_metadata.json)

An ed25519 signature over the JSON bytes can be found at:\
[https://config.mobilecoin.foundation/token\_metadata.sig](https://config.mobilecoin.foundation/token\_metadata.sig)

For a guide level explanation of the JSON schema and its usage, see:\
